# FastNotes API

## Overview

FastNotes is a simple yet powerful API built using FastAPI that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on notes. The notes are stored in a MongoDB database, providing a scalable and efficient solution for managing your notes.

## Features

- **Create Note**: Easily create new notes by sending a POST request to the API.

- **Read Note**: Retrieve notes by sending a GET request. You can filter notes based on importance.

- **Update Note**: Modify existing notes, including updating the importance status.

- **Delete Note**: Remove unwanted notes using a DELETE request.

## Getting Started
